The MATLAB (*.mat) file contains the data of the force-displacement plot from an approved solution of a problem defined as follows.

- A 2D cantilever beam subjected to displacement-control loading at the tip
- plastic material model of the plane-stress case with NO hardening (perfect plasticity)
- the parameters are:
E = 1000 # Elastic modulus
nu = 0.3 # Poisson ratio
lx = 6.0 # beam length
ly = 0.5 # beam height
sig0 = 10.0 # yield stress of material
uy_max = 0.65 # maximum loaded displacement at tip
